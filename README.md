# Boston Housing Price Prediction (Regression)

This project implements a **machine learning regression model** to predict housing prices using the **Boston Housing dataset**. The goal is to analyze various socioeconomic and structural features and estimate the median value of owner-occupied homes.

---

## 📌 Project Description

The Boston Housing dataset contains information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston, Massachusetts.  
This project applies **regression techniques** to build a predictive model and evaluate its performance.

##  Model Evaluation
The model performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R² Score

These metrics help determine the accuracy and reliability of the prediction model.

##  Future Improvements
Feature engineering

Try multiple regression models

Hyperparameter tuning

Model deployment using Flask or FastAPI
